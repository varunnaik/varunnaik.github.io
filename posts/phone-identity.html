	<h1>Phone Numbers and Identity</title></h1>
	<h2>And why conflating the two is not a good idea.</h2>
	<hr />

	<p>Using a phone to verify identity - eg. when signing up for a service online - is quite common these days. This typically happens by sending an SMS to your phone with a code that you type into the website - two factor authentication.</p>

	<p>One reason companies do this is to make it harder for people to create throwaway accounts to spam the service, although this is often done also for security.</p>

	<p>While this may help companies fight spam, 2FA with phones does not actually make your account safer for a few reasons:</p>

	<ol>
	<li>You don't own your phone number, your service provider does. And they can lease it to someone else in accordance to their terms and conditions. I learned this the hard way when my phone company leased my number to someone else after I moved countries. The new person got all my messages from my bank, tax, and every other service I signed up for. Most services also won't let you change your phone number without first sending a confirmation SMS to your current phone.</li>	

	<li>Phone numbers are vulnerable to social engineering. A good social engineer can impersonate you, claim you lost your phone, and convince customer service to transfer your phone number directly to their phone. Customer service refuses? Try again in a few hours to get a different agent, and continue till someone agrees to the request.</li>

	<li>If your phone is set to display the message text on the lock screen, any code can be read over your shoulder without even having to unlock your phone.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Overall, using a phone number to confirm identity is dangerous for all these reasons. If your phone number should happen to be compromised fixing the situation can be extremely difficult.</p>

	<p>On the other hand, using a dedicated security device such as a <a href="https://www.yubico.com/" nofollow>Yubikey</a> for 2FA makes your account much safer.</p>
