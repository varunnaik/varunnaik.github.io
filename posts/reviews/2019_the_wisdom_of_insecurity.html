<h1>The Wisdom of Insecurity</h1>
<p>Alan Watts, 1951</p>

<p>Written in 1951, this book is an attempt to look at the anxiety and insecurity which most of us have in life to varying degrees, and an attempt to guide the reader to find peace in his/her life.</p>
<p>Despite its age the book is still as relevant today as the day it was written, perhaps a stark reminder that despite massive technological advances like computers, mobile phones, jet aircraft, and the Internet, human nature remains the same through the ages.</p>
<h3>The law of reversed effort: </h3>
<p>The law of reversed effort is a major theme of the book.</p>
<p>When you try to stay on the surface of the water, you sink; but when you try to sink, you float. This book applies this principle to man's quest for psychological security. It makes the case that paradoxically, insecurity is the result of trying to be secure.</p>
<!--<blockquote>There is a feeling we live in a time of unusual insecurity. As the years go by, there seem to be fewer and fewer rocks to which we can hold, which we can regard as absolutely right and true, and fixed for all time.</blockquote>-->
<h3>The age of anxiety</h3>
<p>People have a difficult time living in the present and being happy in the now.</p>
<blockquote>Human beings appear to be happy just so long as they have a future to which they can look forward - whether a "good
    time" tomorrow or an everlasting life beyond the grave. More and more people find it hard to believe in the latter.
    On the other hand, the former has the disadvantage that when the "good time" arrives it is hard to enjoy it to the
    full without some promise of more to come. If happiness always depends on something expected in the future, we are
    chasing a will-o'-the-wisp that ever eludes our grasp.</blockquote>

<h3>Atheism and the loss of myths:</h3>
<p>People need something to believe in, something to center their lives around. This used to be religion but as the influence of religion wanes and it is no longer the main provider of purpose, people are left with a void in their lives.</p>

<blockquote>What science has said, in sum, is this: We do not,
    and in all probability cannot. know whether God
    exists. Nothing that we do know suggests that he
    does, and all the arguments which claim to prove his
    existence are found to be without logical meaning.
    There is nothing. indeed, to prove that there is no
    god, but the burden of proof rests with those who
    propose the idea. If. the scientists would say, you believe in God. you must do so on purely emotional
    grounds, without basis in logic or facts. Practically
    speaking. this may amount to atheism. Theoretically,
    it is simple agnosticism. For it is of the essence of
    scientific honesty that you do not pretend to know
    what you do not know, and of the essence of scientific
    method that you do not employ hypotheses which cannot be tested. <strong>Once
    there is a suspicion a religion is a myth, it's power is gone.</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>The immediate results of this honesty have been deeply unsettling and depressing, for man seems to be unable
        to live without myth, without the belief that the routine and drudgery, the pain and the fear have some meaning
        and goal in the future.</strong></blockquote>
<!--<blockquote>It is only possible to ignore this by following the principle, "where ignorance is bliss, it is folly to be wise".
    After all, the atheist and agnostic is often neurotic because of their philosophy, and a simple Catholic is happy
    and at peace. However, to think along these lines is simply to deny reality.</blockquote> -->
<blockquote>Because belief in the eternal is impossible, men seek their happiness in the joys of time - but this leads to the
    anxiety that one is missing something, and the mind flits nervously and greedily from one pleasure to another. It
    leads also to the attitude of "what's the use, anyhow" from the frustration of having to pursue a future good in a
    tomorrow that never comes.</blockquote>

<p>Having no life beyond the grave to look forward to as a reward for enduring the pain and struggle of life, people attempt to distract themselves instead.</p>
<blockquote>We crave distraction - a panorama of sights, sounds, thrills, titillations into which as much as possible must be
    crowded, in as short a time as possible. To keep up this "standard" we put up with lives that consist of largely
    doing jobs that are a bore, earning the means to seek relief from the tedium with intervals of hectic and expensive
    pleasure - with these intervals supposed to be 'real' living. Or we imagine that the justification of such work is
    the rearing of a family to go on doing the same kind of thing.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Paradox as it may seem, we only find life meaningful when we have seen that it is without purpose, and we
         know the mysterity of the universe only when we are convinced we know nothing about it at all.</strong></blockquote>

<h3>Pain and Time</h3>
<p>We spend our lives in the pursuit of pleasure and the me avoidance of pain - yet this is futile because pleasure without pain loses effectiveness quickly - eating ice cream for every meal can get very old quickly.</p>
<blockquote><strong>Because consciousness must involve both pleasure and pain, to strive for pleasure to the exclusion of pain is
        in effect to strive for the loss of consciousness.</strong></blockquote>

<p>People strive for meaning in life, because a life without a purpose to work towards seems like meaningless rote work.</p> 
<blockquote>However, the reason we want life to mean something is not merely because we are trying to get away from pain, but
    instead this arises from our powers of memory and foresight - in short from our consciousness of time. For an animal
    to be happy it is enough that this moment be enjoyable. But man needs enjoyable memories and expectations. With
    these assured he can put up with a miserable present. Without these he can be miserable in the midst of immediate
    physical pleasure.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The power of memories and expectations is that for most human beings, the past and future are not as real, but more
    real than the present. <strong>The present cannot be lived happily unless the past has been "cleared up" and the
        future is bright with promise.</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote>There is a price to be paid for every increase in consciousness. We cannot be more sensitive to pleasure without
    being more sensitive to pain. By remembering the past we can plan for the future. but the ability to plan for
    pleasure is offset by the ability to dread pain and to fear the unknown. The growth of an acute sense of the past
    and future gives us a correspondingly dim sense of the present. Consciousness almost seems to be nature's ingenious
    mode of self-torture.</blockquote>

<!-- <h3>The great stream</h3>
<p>The nature of the universe is fluidity, and life is a stream of events, with each event causing change. We are not really comfortable with change, liking things to remain as they are - for we understand the way things are, or can at least deal with them. Therefore we attempt to resist change and fix things to make them as they were before. This rarely works.</p>
<p><strong>Any attempt to "fix" things will never work, in the context of change. The only way to make sense out of
        change is to plunge into it, move with it, and join the dance.</strong></p>
<p>Conscious thinking has gone ahead and created its own world, and when we find this to be in conflict with the real
    world we have a sense of profound discord between "I", between the conscious thinker and nature.</p>
<blockquote>Words are part of the problem. Because words can only describe a particular instant of time, they are ill-suited to
    describing a world in flux. We confuse words with the real world, and try to live in the real world as if it were
    the world of words - and we become dismayed and dumbfounded when they do not fit.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Neither Science nor religion do a good job of describing reality, because both of these deal with words and symbols -
    symbolising the world and then dealing with the symbols rather than with the world itself. Perhaps that last
    ultimate something which cannot be defined or fixed can be represented by the word God.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"To define" has come to mean almost "to understand."</blockquote>
<p>The miracles of technology cause to to live in a hectic, clockwork world that enables us to do nothing but pursue the
    future, faster and faster.</p> -->

<h3>The Wisdom of the Body</h3>
<p>We try and effect an adaptation to life by means of external gadgets and attempt to solve or problems by conscious
    thinking rather than unconscious know-how. This is much less to our advantage than we like to suppose.</p>
<blockquote>Human desire tends to be insatiable, because of anxiety in the knowledge that in an insecure world, pleasure is
    uncertain. We simulate our sense organs till they become insensitive, so if pleasure is to continue we must have
    stronger and stronger stimulants. The brain is in pursuit of happiness, and because the brain is much more concerned
    about the future rather than the present, it conceives of happiness as the guarantee of an indefinitely long future
    of pleasures. Therefore hardly anyone enjoys what they have, and is forever seeking more and more.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Happiness will therefore consist not of solid and substantial realities, but of such abstract and superficial
        things as promises, hopes, and assurances.</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote>The brainy economy designed to produce happiness is a vicious circle which must either manufacture more pleasures or
    collapse - providing constant titillation of the eyes, ears, and nerve ending s with incessant streams of almost
    inescapable noise and visual distractions. Despite the immense hubbub and nervous strain we are convinced that sleep
    is a waste of valuable time and continue to chase these fantasies far into the night. Because life is short, human
    beings must cram into the years the highest amount of consciousness, alertness, and chronic insomnia so as to be
    sure not to miss the last fragment of startling pleasure.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Generally speaking, the civilized man does not know what he wants - he works for success, fame, a happy
        marriage, fun, to help other people, or to be a "real person." But these are not real wants because they are not
        real things, they are by-products, the flavours and atmospheres of real things. Money is the perfect symbol of
        all such desires.</strong></blockquote>
<!--<p>Of all the pleasures it is sex that the civilized man pursues with the greatest anxiety. That the craving is brainy
    rather than bodily is shown by the common impotence of the man when it comes to the act, his brain pursuing what his
    genes do not at the moment desire. This confuses him greatly because he does not understand not wanting the great
    delicacy of sex when it is available. He has been hankering for it for days on end but when reality appears his body
    won't co-operate. The only means of exploiting it is through cerebral fantasy.</p>-->
<p>The brain is clever enough to see the vicious circle it has made for itself, but can still do nothing about it.
    Seeing it is unreasonable to worry does not stop worrying, rather it causes even more worrying.</p>

<h3>On Being Aware</h3>
<p>Awareness is a view of reality free from ideas and judgements. Because of this, it is impossible to write down what
    it reveals - anything that can be described is an idea. Therefore it is only possible to talk about the false
    impressions awareness removes, rather than the truth it reveals.</p>
<p>To be psychologically secure, all people must first have a minimum livelihood in terms of food, drink, clothing -
    however, the reason this does not transfer to psychological security is because we want much more than the minimum
    necessities.</p>
<blockquote>There is a contradiction in wanting to be perfectly secure in a universe whose very nature is momentariness and
    fluidity.</blockquote>
<blockquote>If I want to be secure - i.e., protected from the flux of life - then I am wanting to be separate from life. Yet this
    very sense of separation makes me feel insecure. To be secure means to fortify the "I" yet it is the feeling of
    being an isolated "I" that makes me lonely and afraid. The more security I can get, the more I shall want.</blockquote>
<blockquote>We want the protection of being "exclusive" and "special," seeking to belong to the safest church, the best nation,
    the highest class, the right set, and the "nice" people.</blockquote>
<blockquote>I can only think of living up to an ideal, of improving myself, if I allow that I am split in two pieces - the good
    "I" who has the best intentions and is going to improve the wayward, bad "me". The tussle between the two will
    stress the difference between them and the "I" will feel more separate than ever, increasing the lonely and cut-off
    feelings that make the "me" behave so badly.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>The craving for security is itself a pain and a contradiction, and the more we pursue it the more painful it
        becomes.</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote>We worry because we feel unsafe and want to be safe, yet it is perfectly useless to say that we should not want to be
    safe. Calling a desire bad names will not get rid of it. What we have to discover is that there is no safety, that
    seeking it is painful, and that when we imagine that we have found it, we don;t like it. When we understand that
    safety is isolation, and when we understand what we do to ourselves looking for it - then we will understand that we
    don't want it at all.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>The principal thing is to understand that there is no safety or security.</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote>To understand that there is no security is far more than to agree with the theory that all things change. The notion
    of security is based on the feeling that there is something within us which is permanent and endures through all the
    days and changes of life. We are struggling to make sure of the permanence, continuity, and safety of this enduring
    core, this centre and soul of our being which we shall call "I". For we think this to be the real man - the thinker
    of our thoughts, the feeler of our feelings, the knower of our knowledge. We do not understand that there is no
    security till we realise that this "I" does not exist.</blockquote>
<blockquote>While the notion that I am separate from my experience remains, there is confusion and turmoil. To understand this
    moment I must not try to be divided from it, I must be aware of it with my whole being. This is not just something I
    should do, in reality it is the only thing I can do.</blockquote>

<h3>The Transformation of Life</h3>
<blockquote>You can establish the theory that your body is a movement in an unbroken process which includes all suns and start,
    and yet continue to feel separate and lonely.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The feeling will not correspond to the theory until you have also discovered the unity of inner experience.Despite
    all theories you will feel isolated from life as long as you are divided within (I vs me).</blockquote>
<blockquote>You cease to feel isolated when you recognise that for example, you don't have a sensation of the sky but are that
    sensation - and there is no "you" apart from what you sense, feel, and know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The divided mind comes to the dinner table and pecks at one dish after another, rushing on without digesting anything
    to find one better than the last. It finds nothing good, because there is nothing it really tastes. When you realise
    that you live in, and indeed you are his moment now and no other, and apart from this there is no past and no
    future, you must relax and taste it to the full, whether it be pleasure or pain.</blockquote>
<blockquote>When each moment becomes an expectation life is deprived of fulfilment, and death is dreaded for it seems here that
    expectation must come to an end.</blockquote>

<h3>Creative Morality</h3>
<blockquote>Morals are for avoiding an unfair distribution of pleasure and pain. </blockquote>
<blockquote>One of the highest pleasures is to be more or less unconscious of one's existence and be absorbed in interesting
    sights, sounds, places, and people. Conversely, one of the greatest pains is to be self-conscious, to feel
    unabsorbed and cut-off from the community and the surrounding world. The meaning of freedom can never be grasped by
    the divided mind.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>The best pleasures are those for which we do not plan, and the worst part of pain is expecting it and trying
        to get away from it when it has come. You cannot plan to be happy.</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote>I am depressed and want to get "I" out of this depression. The opposite of depression is elation, but because
    depression is not elation, I cannot force myself to be elated. I can, however, get drunk. This makes me wonderfully
    elated, and so when the next depression arrives I have a quick cure. The subsequent depressions get deeper and
    blacker, because I am not digesting the depressed state and eliminating its poisons so I need to get even drunker to
    drown them. Very soon I begin to hate myself for getting so drunk, which makes me still more depressed and so it
    goes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The conventional moralist has nothing to contribute to these problems. He can point out the frightful effects of
    alcoholism and gambling, but that is simply more fuel for depression and worry. He can paint glowing pictures of the
    virtues and encourage others to find strength in the example of great men. Beside the examples of saints and heroes
    I feel ashamed that I amount to nothing, so I begin to practice humility because of my wounded pride, and charity
    because of my self-love. The urge is ever to make "I" amount to something. I must be right, good, a real person,
    heroic, loving, self-effacing. I efface myself in order to assert myself and give myself away to keep myself.</blockquote>
<blockquote>If I am afraid my efforts to feel and act bravely are moved by fear. For I am afraid of fear.</blockquote>


<h3>The Marvellous Moment</h3>
<blockquote><strong>To be aware of reality, of the living present, is to discover that at each moment, the experience is all. There is
    nothing else beside it. No experience of "you" experiencing the experience.</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote>In times of happiness and pleasure, we are usually aware of the moment and allow the experience to be all we don't
    pause to think "this is joy" unless the joy is past its peak or there is some anxiety it will go away. But when pain
    arrives - whether physical or emotional, real or anticipated, the split begins and the circle goes around.</blockquote>
<blockquote> There are two ways of understanding an experience - one way is to compare it with the memories of other
    experiences, name it, and define it. The other way is to be aware of it as is, just like when in the intensity of
    joy, we forget past and future and let present be all, not even stopping to think "I am happy."</blockquote>
<blockquote>When we try to understand the present by comparing it with memories, we do not understand it as deeply as when we are
    aware of it without comparison. This however is the way in which we approach unpleasant experiences - instead of
    being aware of them as they are, we try to deal with them in terms of the past.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The frightened or lonely person begins at once to think "I'm afraid," or "I'm so lonely" in an attempt to avoid the
    experience because we don't want to be aware of this present yet the only way to escape is into the safe ground of
    memories which are fixed and known. To try to control fear or depression or boredom by calling them names is to
    resort to superstition of trust in curses and invocations.</blockquote>
<blockquote>On the other hand, if you are aware of fear then you realise that because this fear is yourself, escape is
    impossible. You then have no choice but to be aware of it as an entirely new experience.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Our lives are one long effort to resist the unknown, the real present in which we live, which is the unknown in the
    midst of coming into being. At every moment we are cautious, hesitant, and on the defensive. And to no avail because
    life thrusts us into the unknown willy nilly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The art of living in this "predicament" is being completely sensitive to each moment and regarding it as completely
    new and unique. This is not a philosophical theory but an experiment. One has to make the experiment to understand
    that it brings into play altogether new powers of adaptation to life, of literally absorbing pain and insecurity.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Nervous and frustrated people are always busy, even in being idle, such idleness being the "laziness" of fear not of
    reset.</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>To remain stable is to refrain from trying to separate yourself from a pain because you know you cannot.
        Running away from fear is fear, fighting pain is pain, trying to be brave is being scared.</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote>If the mind is in pain, the mind is in pain. There is no escape. Sometimes when resistance ceases, the pain simply
    goes away or dwindles to an easily tolerable ache. When you see that you are the pain, pain ceases to be a motive,
    and you realise that it hurts - period. This is not an experiment to be held in reserve, but a way of life. It means
    being aware, alert, and sensitive to the present moment always, in all actions and relations whatsoever, beginning
    this instant. There really is no alternative because you cannot separate yourself from the present and you cannot
    define it. <strong>This is not a psychological or spiritual discipline for self improvement. It is simply being
        aware that you can neither define it nor divide yourself from it.</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote>The revolutionary thinker must go beyond thought. He knows that all his best ideas come to him when thinking has
    stopped.When thought stops from exhaustion, te mind is open to see the problem as it is - not as it is verbalised,
    and at once the problem is understood.</blockquote>
<blockquote>It is in vain that we can predict and control the course of events in the future unless we know how to live in the
    present. It is in vain that doctors prolong life if we spend the extra time being anxious to live still longer.
    Tools such as these are only useful to men if they are awake and not lost in the dreamland of the past and future
    but are in the closest touch with that point of experience where reality can alone be discovered - this moment.</blockquote>
