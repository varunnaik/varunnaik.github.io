    <h1>Track and Photograph Ships with Software Defined Radio</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>First, the photographs: You can view them online on the capture website for the project at the <a
        href="https://blog.vnaik.com/sydney-ships/#" target="_blank">Sydney Ships Viewer</a>.</p>
    <p>A Software Defined Radio allows you to pick up all kinds of interesting signals using cheap commercial hardware.
      A
      RTL dongle is easily obtained online and combined with a Raspberry Pi, creates a perfect platform for experiments.
      I used an <a href="http://www.nooelec.com/store/nesdr-mini-rtl2832-r820t.html">RTL2832 dongle</a> for this
      project, and there are several alternatives available as listed on the <a href="https://www.rtl-sdr.com/">RTL-SDR
        website</a>.</p>

    <p>Ships at sea broadcast AIS (Automatic Identification System) messages every few minutes when underway. They also
      broadcast messages when at port at a slower frequency. The AIS system aids navigation - other vessels can use this
      information to plot their courses, avoiding collisions.</p>

    <p>This project uses the RTL dongle to listen to these signals and track ships as they move into and out of the
      Sydney harbour.</p>

    <p>In particular I wanted to count the traffic under the harbour bridge and to Circular Quay (the geofenced area
      below). In addition, having access to a location with line of sight to the area in question, I wanted to
      photograph the ships exactly as they passed under the harbour bridge and in front of the opera house.</p>

    <p>Using the GPS coordinates from the AIS messages, it is possible to compute if the ship is inside the geofence or
      not, and a ship entering the geofenced area can be used as a trigger to start a capture.</p>

    <p>The Raspberry Pi camera, though cheap, isn't the best for taking pretty pictures - particularly when you're only
      interested in a small portion of the image being captured. The sensor quality leaves a lot to be desired and
      I found that using a cheap smartphone zoom lens (2x) massively improved the captures.</p>

    <p>This uses the excellend <a href="https://github.com/dgiardini/rtl-ais">RTL-AIS</a> project to process incoming
      AIS messages and <a href="https://pypi.org/project/libais/">libais</a> to access them in Python.</p>

    <p>After putting a restart script in place to recover from crashes,I ran the project for a few weeks and got some
      good captures of ships transiting the Sydney Opera House.</p>

    <p>The data reported by the ships themselves was not always accurate, with some jumps in position that needed to be
      filtered out. The Sydney harbour also has massive traffic - and most of the vessels are too small to photograph
      with the Raspberry Pi camera, so ships too small to photograph well need to be filtered out.</p>

    <p>In theory the AIS messages themselves carry information such as the ship's dimensions, draught, name, and even
      destination port. In practice, this information is self-reported with no real standards, and the information
      (other than the MMSI identifier and the GPS co-ordinates) is often wildly inaccurate. I attempt to filter out
      ships smaller than 80 metres in length to reduce the number of false captures although this often fails because
      not all ships report accurate sizes.</p>

    <p>The project has been running well for a couple of years now, although there are occiassional dropouts if the Pi
      crashes.</p>
